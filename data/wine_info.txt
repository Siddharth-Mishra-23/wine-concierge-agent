Company Overview
Welcome to Vinetos de Sol, a family-owned winery nestled in the heart of Napa Valley, California. Our journey began in 1985 when founders Elena and Javier Perez purchased a small plot of land with a vision to craft exceptional wines that capture the unique terroir of our region. Our philosophy is simple: let nature guide the process. We practice sustainable viticulture and use minimal intervention to produce wines that are a true expression of the land. Our commitment to quality and tradition has made us a beloved destination for wine lovers worldwide.

Wine Collection
Vinetos de Sol specializes in several premium varietals, each with its own distinct character.

Cabernet Sauvignon (The "Eclipse" Series): This is our flagship wine, known for its bold structure and rich flavors of black cherry, cassis, and a hint of vanilla. The grapes are sourced from our sun-drenched estate vineyards, yielding a wine with a long, elegant finish.

Chardonnay (The "Luna" Series): Our Chardonnay is barrel-fermented to create a balanced profile. It's crisp and refreshing with notes of green apple and pear, complemented by subtle undertones of toasted almond and butter. It pairs wonderfully with light seafood and poultry dishes.

Merlot (The "Serenity" Series): A smooth and approachable red wine. It offers soft tannins and vibrant fruit flavors of plum and red berries, with a touch of cocoa on the finish. Perfect for those who enjoy a versatile and food-friendly wine.
